In April I had the opportunity to participate in the Basecamp, the basic
training and admission process of École 42. It is a nonprofit and tuition-free
computer programming school focused on creating Human Coders. It has campuses
all over the world, the one I've ingressed is at **São Paulo - Brazil**. To
understand more about the school you can visit their
[website](https://www.42.fr/).

## The Basecamp

The Basecamp is an online version of the Piscine, where you start learning
about Shell and C. Most of the time you are doing the assignments and sharing
knowledge with the other participants. There are also tests(one every week) and
*Rushes*(projects you do every weekend with a randomly selected group).

It was a really fun and enlightening experience, which made my admission even
more special.

## Projects

The school, much like their admission process, consists of several projects,
where you learn and get tested about the projects subject. As an example, the
first project is called **libft**, in which you need to learn about and
recreate `libc` functions.

All of my projects will be documented [here](/blog/tags/ecole42), with
references and some insights. Hope you all enjoy it!
