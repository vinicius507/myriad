One day I was looking at my YouTube recommendation feed, like I do most days to kill time, and stumbled upon a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bXEUSAiTI) of a George Hotz twitch live.
The video itself has nothing to do with emulators, but in the video he addresses his viewers comments to "teach them programming lessons".
The beginning of the video is more of a rant against current business models in software engineering but, when talking about the general idea behind how to get good at programming, he iterates over the idea that a good programmer is able to:
1. Understand a complex system
2. Modify it
3. Test and ship the modified version

And what is the best way of learning how to do this? **Practice**.

Of course, it is essentially impossible to never make mistakes, but the point is: to become good at this "simple algorithm" of what makes a great programmer, it takes tons of practice.

Not long after, Fabio Akita, a brazilian developer and CEO, posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUqLLpUJ47s) on his YouTube channel about games and emulators.
And it just clicked on me.
The first thing I did? Googling "how to build an emulator" and, in the first few results, there was a website called [emulator101](emulator101.com). And that's how this project begun.  

Right now you can check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vinicius507/invaders-8080) and accompany me in this new journey.
