Hey, I'm Vinícius! I'm a software engineer in João Pessoa, Brazil. This is the
spot for some of my projects, tutorials, guides, notes and everything I'd like
to backup from my brain.

I've started studying Computer Science at the Federal University of
Paraíba(UFPB), but ended up dropping the course. Then, I got accepted as a
Cadet at École 42 São Paulo, an international software engineering school,
where I learnt that I love helping people and sharing what I learn(hence the
blog).
